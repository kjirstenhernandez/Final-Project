# Overview

Using the Parcel framework, **catlas** is a website meant for cat people.  It allows you to view every domesticated cat breed in the world, and uses local storage to allow users to add or remove cat breeds to or from their favorites list. It fetches the breeds from The Cat API, and dynamically loads all pages, which includes the breed overpage as well as a detailed page when a specific breed is selected.  It also features a yarn mouse as an cursor and a javascript image carousel.   

By creating this software I've provided both an excellent reference website for any domesticated cat breed and a visually pleasing site to freely visit to look at cat pictures anytime excess seratonin is needed.
