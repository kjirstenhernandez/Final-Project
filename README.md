# Overview

**Catlas** is a website built for cat lovers using the Parcel framework. It allows users to explore every domesticated cat breed in the world and provides a way to save favorite breeds using local storage. The site fetches breed data from [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) and dynamically loads pages, including a breed overview and a detailed page for each selected breed.

Catlas also features a playful design, including a yarn mouse cursor and a JavaScript image carousel.

By creating this website, Iâ€™ve provided both an excellent reference for domesticated cat breeds and a visually enjoyable space where anyone can browse cat pictures whenever they need a serotonin boost.

# Development Environment

The website was developed using JavaScript in Visual Studio Code.
